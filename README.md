# Pokemon-Game
Using python to create data structures and functions for a new Pokemon game


No more moving around outside!


Design mock-ups for a new game called Pokemon Stay: in this version players still need to move, but just from website to website. Pokemon gyms are now popular online destinations, and catching Pokemon in the "wild" simply requires browsing the internet for hours in the comfort of your home.

I program a prototype version of the game, and analyze the planned content to help the team calibrate the design.

Having buil the game components and loaded supplementary data, I use statistics and probability to describe and refine the gameplay.
